For the sake of time, I had to forcefully solve it by approving a pull request that authorized the emergency merge. This was similar to a hotfix but since I didn't understand the concept well.

        "    * In the end, I ran everything to verify that it works well. However, and therefore, I didn't realize that when I commented my code using Gemini's help, it changed the outputs of some of my definitions. I was always careful because I noticed it several times. In fact, I asked it not to do it. But I must be more careful and do thorough reviews before moving on to final steps in the main branches.
